\arguments{
\item{data}{a matrix/data.frame/list/vector of abundances-based/incidences-based species data.\cr
Type (1) abundance data:\cr
When there are N assemblages, the
observed species abundances should be arranged as a species (in rows) by assemblage (in columns) matrix. The first row
(including N entries) lists the assemblage labels or site names for the N assemblages.\cr
Type (2) incidence data:\cr
The data input format for incidence data must be raw detection/non-detection data. That is, data for each community/assemblage
consist of a species-by-sampling-unit matrix. Users must first merge multiple-community data by species identity to obtain a pooled
list of species; then the rows of the input data refer to this pooled list. \cr}

\item{class}{a choice of three-level diversity: 
'TD' = 'Taxonomic', 'PD' = 'Phylogenetic', and 'FD' = 'Functional' under certain threshold. Besides,'AUC' is the fourth choice which integrates several threshold functional diversity to get diversity.}

\item{datatype}{data type of input data: individual-based abundance data (\code{datatype = "abundance"}),
sampling-unit-based incidence frequencies data (\code{datatype = "incidence_freq"}) or species by sampling-units incidence matrix (\code{datatype = "incidence_raw"}).\cr}

\item{tree}{a phylo object describing the phylogenetic tree in Newick format for all observed species in the pooled assemblage. It is necessary when \code{class = 'PD'}.}

\item{distM}{a pair wise distance matrix for all pairs of observed species in the pooled assemblage. It will be use when \code{class = 'FD' or 'AUC'}.}

\item{nT}{needed only when \code{datatype = "incidence_raw"}, a sequence of named nonnegative integers specifying the number of sampling units in each assemblage.
If \code{names(nT) = NULL}, then assemblage are automatically named as "assemblage1", "assemblage2",..., etc.
It is necessary when \code{class = 'PD'} and \code{datatype = "incidence_raw"}.}

\item{nboot}{an integer specifying the number of bootstrap replications, default is 30.\cr}

\item{p_row}{number of row for 4steps figure, default = 2.}

\item{p_col}{number of column for 4steps figure, default = 3.}

\item{details}{a logical variable to determine whether do you want to print out the detailed value of 4 plots, default is \code{FALSE}.\cr}
}
\value{
a list of two of objects: \cr\cr
\code{$summary} individual summary of 4 steps of data. \cr\cr
\code{$figure} 5 figures of analysis process. \cr\cr
\code{$details} the information for generating \code{figure}. \cr
If you need it, you should key in \code{details = TRUE}. \cr\cr

\description{
\code{iNEXT4steps}:\cr
A complete (random sampling) biological analysis combined with four parts:\cr
Step1: Sample Completeness.\cr
Step2: Interpolation and Extrapolation.\cr
Step3: Asymptotic diversity.\cr
Step4: Evenness.\cr
